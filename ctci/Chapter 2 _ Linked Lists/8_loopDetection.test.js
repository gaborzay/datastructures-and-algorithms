/**
 * Loop Detection
 *
 * Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at
 * the beginning of the loop.
 * DEFINITION
 * Circular linked list: A (corrupt) linked list in which a node's next pointer
 * points to an earlier node, so as to make a loop in the linked list.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> C [the same C as earlier]
 * Output: C
